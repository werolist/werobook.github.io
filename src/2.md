# Koniec

absolutely everything about it is perfect the video song is beautiful the lyrics are great and the song is fucking incredible like I love every single note, I've heard it like 30 times i think, the frunÄ™ teraz lines are so beautiful I want to be able to say it myself someday and soon (not just say it out loud lol (I have managed that much but I can only sing it like it is in the song I can't say it as a sentence because I don't know how you intonate in polish it's kinda funny) you know what I mean). I looked for the movie and it looks like it's not available online yet, and the CD is only on Polish sites never mind that I haven't seen a CD player in 10 years. I heard one or two other songs from the movie as well, it looks quite tragic but I've only heard good things about it from you (on the cursed world) and others so I will wait. and let it not be said I am biased because you already ordered it first in the list or that because the video song is so good I am biased. half my listens were on spotify [thumbs up] so you are wrong. I would genuinely put it in my top 20 songs in general | period setting in unedited greenscreen is actually aesthetic lol I never would've imagined. I would genuinely watch a full length movie like that. and the first few notes of the vocalisation at the start of the song sound like the tetris soundtrack I tried to hum along and got confused
