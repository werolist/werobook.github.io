# Kocham

i like it, his voice fits the strong (I did not misspell string) instruments quite well, and you say it is a protest song but he really is just asking to please not be bothered, to be left alone, is how I read it. induces pity. quite sad, mellow. but I like it. I like the ch≈Çopcy version better than the alternative you added below, that one is so dramatic it comes off funny.
