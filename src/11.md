# Eldorado

what can I say, if eldorado has 10000 fans I am one of them and if eldorado has no fans it means I am dead. love all of it. I am now familiar with longing for home even when the current place of stay is by no means inadequate in particular. Nie mój świat (is it not that part lol). I love how passionate the lyrics are about the hometown. usually such statements are wrapped in irony and never so vulnerable and open about it, if that makes sense. And are both the artists singing? I can't tell their voices apart in the solos (fake fan, poser, etc.), unless it is just sanah doing the solos. | I like all the slang words at the end. she REALLY just wants back home lol she's going over all her favourite things to find some peace. it's how I used to think of biryani or tea on my powercut nights. | I find myself saying wla saskerland randomly throughout the day because it sounds like voila, saskerland! and it sounds like she's on a roadtrip and finally made it to saskerland and she's excited about it like yayy saskerland
