I think it's nice, it sounds like ps2 era dbz game music lol, not a bad thing at all but it threw me off the first time. also I thought it was familiar and yes it sounds like the first aot ost too I'm so sorry my brain is rotten. do the first two lines mean, you are only allowed to speak if you are not special? is metamorfozy related to metamorphosis? usually when I read european languages at least I can anchor myself to words that occur in english too of latin or whatever origin but with polish there's far fewer of those so I'm often completely on my own. I did like pozytywne being positive though lol (in pokaż). the harshness of singing and instrument conveys the feeling of being under spiritual oppression quite well I think. not harsh but you know what I mean.
