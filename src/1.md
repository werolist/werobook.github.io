# Preamble
- POTRZEBA LINK ON THE LIST PAGE GOES TO HTTPS://NIEPOTRZEBA [facepalm] (I fixed it here so we're good)

- I had to abandon the idea of emojis here. A lot of emojis span multiple unicodepoints, but when they go through the encrypt-decrypt, there's no way to decide whether it's the codepoints separately, or combined. So you will see some like [demon mask] or some other would-have-been emojis. Also had to abandon clickable hyperlinks because it's annoying inner-html fidgeting.

- Two songs on the youtube playlist are unavailable for me, Koniec Lata and idk what the other one is because everything else checks out maybe it's the other version of kocham? Anyway I only listen to the songs on not-malware so it's fine if the youtube playlist is incomplete.

- Do understand that these are all ravings I typed out at random times of day over the weeks, and the formatting and punctuation are awful. Do forgive.

- Wherever you see a | it means whatever follows is from a future listening session. So these are all thoughts compiled over dozens of playthroughs, even if not necessarily the entire playlist each time.

- I thought of fixing the punctuation and all that so it goes well with the oh so sharp looking website, but it is likely I will keep yapping with ||| in the times to come so it felt a bit redundant.

<p>Off we go!</p>
