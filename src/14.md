# Długość

the instruments sound somewhat rustic and I think that fits the whole mood of the song. but it's so lonely and tragic even in sound I don't see myself listening to it regularly. And if I am not misreading it, hundreds of whims but they're not me reminds me of plath's fig tree (I heard about it on reels, who am I kidding I do not read literature). I like the song though. I feel bad for the guitarist I hope he has found peace. but I do not like the singer's voice all that much, maybe it should indeed have been him going through it as everyone thought.
