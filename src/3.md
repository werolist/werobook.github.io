# Potrzeba

i like songs with lyrics that start immediately with the song, and i like upbeat without angst. i want to give it a very high ranking but you have added many other good songs (inconsiderate). video song is nice I like the guy singing he seems chill as hell [call-me hand] lyrics are simple and positive and hopeful although I don't understand why at the end they let the bride go again after managing to find her and breaking the guy's face. | what is manna? | I actually like how the same lines play at a different speed on each of the 3 times it's such a nice gimmick | I looked up manna, is the song actually talking about the biblical manna? | I don't know why you tried to undersell this one it bangs. | okay I love this one too, I usually don't like the "not in the actual story but actually is the main character to us; fourth wall resident" trope but I like the guy's vibe lmao maybe because he reminds me of Craig Ferguson (old late night host) | to me guilty pleasure is just pleasure.
