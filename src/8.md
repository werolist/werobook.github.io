I think it's nice. it's hopecore but he is not so confident about it himself. it's more of a I'm saying positive things hoping I'll be convinced myself, than confidently asserting that all will be well. like hey man the stakes are high just try ok I'll try as well. and the sound is very nostalgic so extra points. it reminds me of Crashday (ooold semi-obscure car-everything pc game with a fantastic ost, ultra mega recommend if you have like 8 hours to throw away) soundtrack (or just look up the soundtrack yeah).
