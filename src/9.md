I like the sound of it, the lyrics feel a bit like they're pandering to rural folk, am I misled? he feels like too big of a popstar to be going I'm an innocent little townsboy [pleading face] but if it's just him empathising with rural people then I think it's quite nice. I like the znowu jade ... part in particular. but I will be honest, to me dawid podsiadło usually sounds a bit too-well-produced from the little I have heard of him. not overproduced, but the sound is very squeaky clean and sanitary that doesn't fit the vibe sometimes. is the last third of the song, about liens etc., about cityfolk moving in and gentrifying the countryside? do you feel that happening to your town as well? | okay I just watched the video song again, it's pretty etc. but if my gentrification reading is correct, then the video is about just the opposite, bringing a piece of country life out into the drab city. or it could be that it's about how a country person would feel in the city, isolated in all the concrete, relocated tree. very clever I think, certainly elevates the song in my mind
