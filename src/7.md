# Sobą

sobą I think it fits in perfectly with miraże, the guy tells us about his breakfast and his acts of expression during his day and going to the ball and expressing what he thinks of Magda, where miraże tells you not to do any of these things. not me pretending to be a literature connoisseur noticing connections across works when you did so much exposition lmao but yeah. But since I don't want to lie to you, I can NOT stand the song itself I am so so sorry if you like it particularly. especially when he goes to repeat on chcemy być sobą wreszcie 10000 times. I will only read your translation from now if you will forgive. | WHY do the lyrics say chciałbym and not chcemy like you said like 20 times | okay if you get past the 10000 sobą it's actually good, the instruments are pleasant and calming. I think I'll edit all the sobą out and listen to what's left
