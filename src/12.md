# Byłomineło

sounds great, not much to say about this one. video song is very pretty, the song reminds me of without you by oh wonder, even though the lyrics are a perfect opposite. soft voice woman and quieter low-pitch man. also it's kindof impressive how they say the first three lines so many times, it sounds like a tongue twister to me. do you find it that easy too? | after a few more listens I have warmed up to it. very calming and jolly. hopeful-esque song even if the content is about parting and trying to move on.
